Fewer row and section components. Breaking: `EAccordion` is removed (use `EDisclosure` items sharing a `group`; `EDisclosure` gains a `title` slot and its `title` prop is optional). `EMetaList`, `EDetailRow`, `EItemList` and `EItemRow` are removed: `EDescriptionList` now takes optional `label` (leave every label out for a plain icon list), `icon`, `badge`/`badgeTone` and `editable` per item, emits `edit`, and has a scoped `action` slot for a row's end (stamp, button). `EFormSection` is removed: use `EFieldset` with `section` (`legend` is the title, `hint` the description; `headingLevel` and `gap` are gone). The Disclosure chevron uses the card stroke token and honours forced colours.
