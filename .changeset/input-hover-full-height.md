The hover highlight on text inputs, the search bar and wrapped fields now covers the whole field, including the strip under the top edge. It used to be the field's background, which the inset top shadow sat over, so the top few pixels never showed it; it is now a flat fill laid over the shadow (red-tinted on an invalid field).

`surface-hover`, the hover tone for fields, rows, items and tiles, is now a neutral step (`surface` pulled 9% toward `ink`) instead of the brand-tinted `surface-tint`. A hovered item still matches the selected nav item.
