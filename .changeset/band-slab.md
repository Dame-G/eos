"@eos-ui/vue": patch

Buttons, tabs and the current nav item now draw their raised edge (the slab) inside their own outline, as an inset shadow shifted by the lift, instead of as an offset copy of the box behind it. The slab still follows the corners up the sides, which gives the depth, but the box has one outline, so the corner no longer shows a fringe or a thickened crescent where two antialiased shapes overlapped. Every control is still one control height tall.
